> *"The harness — not the model — is the bottleneck."*
> — Can Bölük, [*The Harness Problem*](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem)

Most edit tools ask the model to echo the old code **token-for-token** before it can change anything
— and that's exactly where agents fail: 46–51% patch-format failure rates for several models with
replace-style edits. **dsh-hashline-edittool** goes deeper. Every line of a file gets a
unique `<line>#<hash>` marker (absolute line number + 3-char content hash), and edits target
those markers. The old text is never echoed, the hash half survives edits above, and every
resolved range is verified against exactly what the model saw — wrong-line edits cannot silently
land, and the post-edit `Shift:` block lets the model chain the next edit without a re-read.

## Why you need this

`str_replace` makes the model re-type the code it's replacing — pure transcription cost (output tokens, billed ~5-6× input), and where agents fail most: 46–51% patch failures on real models, worse on bigger blocks, each failure costing a re-read and a retry.

Hashline sends two `<line>#<hash>` anchors instead of the old text — **26% fewer edit tokens** (24–45% on multi-line ranges) — and verifies every range against what the model saw: an edit lands where you meant, or fails loudly with fresh anchors. Anchors are content addresses that survive edits above; chained edits skip the re-read by reading the post-edit `Shift:` block — and a leaner context keeps the model's attention on the code, not on re-transcribing it.

Not for one-line touch-ups (near parity) or new files (`write`). It pays off in long sessions and structural edits — anywhere an edit must not land on the wrong line.

## Quick Start

### Install

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:hyperion2144/dsh-hashline-edittool   # from github
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-hashline-edittool   # from npm
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-hashline-edittool   # from a local checkout
```

The profile's next session runs with the hashline tools installed. To verify the layer is active:

```sh
dsh --profile <name> --dump-config   # shows a "# == dsh-hashline-edittool" layer
```

| Requirement | |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` (dsh's requirement; the store uses `node:sqlite`) |
| Profile | a dsh profile (`dsh plugin` initializes one on first use) |
| Backends | sandboxed / remote filesystems supported (writes go through `ctx.fs`) |

`read` returns every line as `<line>#<hash>│<content>` — the absolute line number (1-indexed) plus a 3-char content-derived hash. The response opens with a `HASH IDENTIFIER │ FILE LINES` header that separates the marker column from the verbatim file content:

```text
HASH IDENTIFIER │ FILE LINES
 3#ve7│function hello() {
 4#szJ│  console.log("world");
 5#kQm│}
```

`edit` targets one or more ranges of `line#hash` anchors via an `edits:[]` array, each with an `op` semantic (`ins` / `del` / `replace`). A single-line replace:

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.ts",
  "edits": [
    { "op": "replace", "from": "4#szJ", "lines": ["  console.log('hi');"] }
  ]
}
```

and produces a diff with fresh anchors **plus** a `Shift:` block that describes how absolute line numbers below the edit moved — the next edit chains from there without a re-read:

```text
HASH IDENTIFIER │ FILE LINES
+ 4#a3m│  console.log('hi');
- 4#szJ│  console.log("world");

Shift: lines > 5 shift by +1. Use newLine=5#kQm to edit the next row without re-reading.
```


## Configuring Guidance per Preset

The `tool:read` / `tool:edit` / `tool:undo_last_edit` / `tool:grep` guidance sections are
plain-markdown files, overridable per agent preset. Override files live in the plugin's shared
home — never the workspace store:

```
$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-hashline-edittool/<preset>/<section>.md
```

(default home `~/.dsh`, so `~/.dsh/plugins/dsh-hashline-edittool/`). The section table:

| File | Section | Default order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read.md` | `tool:read` | 130 |
| `edit.md` | `tool:edit` | 131 |

| `undo_last_edit.md` | `tool:undo_last_edit` | 132 |

On first boot the plugin seeds the four shipped presets — `standard/`, `code/`,
`minimal/`, `cordis/` — each with the compiled guidance as editable files (plus
`order` front-matter), so every preset's guidance starts editable rather than
blank. A `README.md` at the plugin-home root documents the scheme. Files are
seeded once and never rewritten, so your edits survive — a reset is the one
exception (see *Reset / restore defaults* below). A preset directory may
hold only the sections you want to override — the rest fall through to the
compiled defaults.

A file is pure prose unless it opens with an `order` front-matter fence, which moves the section in
the assembled system prompt:

```md
---
order: 150
---

<section text>
```

Per section, resolution reads `<preset>/<section>.md`, else the compiled
default. Files are read once per agent at session-start, so edits apply to new
sessions — never mid-session. A preset with no seeded directory (e.g. a
user-authored one) falls back to the compiled defaults unless you copy a seeded
dir to its name. A deployment without the `agentPresets` service (no preset
roster) keeps the compiled defaults and never touches these files; presets are
never required.

### Reset / restore defaults

Emptying or deleting an override file restores that section's compiled default
guidance and order: the default renders at session-start, and the file re-seeds
at next boot.

- **Reset = delete the file, or empty it AND remove the front-matter fence.** A whitespace-only file with no fence means "I want the default" — the compiled default renders, and the file re-seeds at next boot for any preset dir, shipped or custom.
- **Blank on purpose = keep a valid fence.** Any well-formed `---` fence — even a keyless `---\n---\n`, even an empty body — is a deliberate-intent signal: the file is explicit content and is never reset or re-seeded.
- **Broken fence = fast fail.** A `---` fence that does not parse (missing closing `---`, non-integer `order`, unknown key) is rejected: the malformed text is never injected into the context, the compiled default renders, a warning names the file and the reason, and the file is left untouched on disk for repair.
- **Shipped vs custom.** Shipped preset files (`standard`, `code`, `minimal`, `cordis`) re-seed at boot; a deleted custom-preset override stays absent — absence is no override. Deleting a whole `<preset>/` directory re-seeds all four section files at boot (shipped presets).
- **Reset restores the current bundle defaults** — a plugin upgrade yields new defaults.

Re-seeding happens at boot, never mid-session.

## Why Hashline

**Token-saving.** An edit call carries `remove_from` / `remove_to` (two `<line>#<hash>` markers)
plus the replacement text — it never echoes the text being replaced. A `str_replace` call must
reproduce that text verbatim. On a 12-edit session over a realistic file this is **26% fewer output
tokens** (24–45% on multi-line ranges) — and these are *output* tokens, billed at ~5-6× the input
rate. See the [benchmark](#benchmark).

**But this was never about “fewest tokens.”** Savings scale with the replaced text — near parity
on the shortest one-line touch-ups — and a compact patch language like
[@oh-my-pi/hashline](#how-it-compares) can emit a lighter payload still (42–53% on the same
session). The point is the *right* kind of edit call: no re-typing old code, and nothing for the
model to track except two stable content addresses (the hash half stays the same across edits;
the line half shifts in the `Shift:` block, with `newLine#oldHash` for the next anchor).

**Correctness.** Every resolved edit range is verified against the exact lines the model was shown.
A stale, never-served, or ambiguous range is hard-rejected **before anything is written**, and the
current range is echoed back as fresh anchors (reject-and-serve) — the retry needs no `read`.

**A modern edit pattern for agents.** Content-addressed anchors (the 3-char hash) survive edits
above; the `line#hash` form additionally pins the line's absolute position. Edit one part of a
file and the rest of the line#hash markers shift predictably — the post-edit response carries a
`Shift:` block (`lines > N shift by +K`) that lets the model chain the next edit via
`newLine#oldHash` without a re-read.

### How It Compares

| | hashline `edit` | `str_replace` (Claude Code / Codex) | @oh-my-pi/hashline patch |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Replaced text never echoed in the call | ✅ 2 hashes only | ❌ verbatim | ✅ `+` rows only |
| Lines addressed by | line number + content hash | text match | number + file-content tag |
| Verified against what the model saw | ✅ every line | ❌ first match wins | ~ file version only |
| Stale file detected | ✅ rejects, fresh anchors | ❌ may match wrong spot | ✅ tag mismatch → refuse or 3-way merge |
| Anchors survive edits above | ✅ content-addressed (hash) + Shift block (line) | ✅ content-based | ❌ renumber + new tag |
| Chained edits without re-reads | ✅ Shift block + newLine#oldHash | ~ | ~ via edit-response numbers |
| Unambiguous when text repeats | ✅ boundary anchors verified | ❌ first occurrence | ~ position, unverified per line |
| Wrong-line edit never lands silently | ✅ every line verified | ❌ first match wins | ~ possible in principle (tag checks version, not lines) |
| Block ops / registers / `MV` / `REM` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| One document per change | ❌ per-edit call | ❌ per-edit call | ✅ multi-hunk patch |
| Runtime | ✅ Node (dsh) | — | ⚠️ Bun only |
| Undo | ✅ persisted | ❌ | ❌ not in scope |

> `~` = occasionally / inconsistently. `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a compact line-anchored patch language
> ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/hashline), [repo](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/tree/main/packages/hashline)):
> `[path#tag]` headers bind each hunk to a full-file content hash, `PUT N.=M:` addresses lines by
> number, and every edit renumbers — take the next numbers and tag from the edit response or a fresh `read`.

**Different jobs, same lineage.** Both descend from the
[harness-problem](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) insight that the model should never
re-type old code. `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a **patch-language library** — payload-light (42% saved
per edit, 53% in a single batch document, see [benchmark](#benchmark)), with syntactic block ops
(`PUT N*:`), registers, `REM`/`MV`, multi-hunk documents, a pluggable filesystem for any backend,
and session-aware 3-way-merge recovery on stale tags. This plugin is a **dsh tool pair**: `read`
hands the model 3-char content hashes, `edit` takes two of them, and every resolved line is verified
against the served state — no line numbers to renumber, no tag to re-fetch, a wrong anchor can never
land on the wrong line, and `undo_last_edit` survives restarts. Its trade-offs: a JSON envelope per
edit costs a little payload, there are no block ops, and it lives inside dsh (Node) rather than as a
standalone patcher (Bun). Pick hashline-the-library for a cross-backend patch format; pick
hashline-the-tool for verified, content-addressed edits in your agent.

### Correctness in edge cases

The token benchmark measures the payload the model emits — it assumes the model gets every
address right, for free. Correctness is where the two hashline implementations actually diverge.
These are the real failure modes from the harness-problem literature (wrong-line edits, drift,
repeated text), and what each tool does when they hit:

| Edge case | hashline `edit` (this plugin) | @oh-my-pi/hashline patch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wrong address (off-by-one anchor / line number) | **Impossible** — anchors resolve to specific lines; every resolved line is verified against served state, rejected **before** anything is written | **Possible** — a wrong line number against a current tag applies **silently** at the wrong place; the tag proves the file version, never the lines |
| File changed on disk after the model's view | Hard reject + fresh anchors echoed (reject-and-serve); retry needs no `read` | Tag mismatch → refuse **or best-effort 3-way merge** onto unknown current content |
| An edit above shifts the file | Nothing shifts — anchors are content addresses; the diff serves fresh anchors | **Every edit renumbers** — “RE-GROUND AFTER EVERY EDIT” is the format's own #1 rule; the model carries the bookkeeping |
| Repeated / identical text | Per-line hashes are unique (collision-resolved); ambiguity → `[E_AMBIGUOUS_ANCHOR]` | Position-based, so repeats don't confuse it — but the position itself is unverified |
| Lines never shown to the model | `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` — hard reject with fresh anchors | Undisplayed hunks rejected — same reliance on the model knowing what it saw |
| Mid-expression / wrong block node | Irrelevant — any verified line range is valid | Grammar rules + `PUT N*:` node choice; mispointing (anchoring `def` orphans its decorator) silently lands wrong; no syntax check |
| Multi-edit batch fails mid-way | `edit`'s `edits` array — atomic, all-or-nothing; the failing item is echoed as fresh serves | Multi-section patches preflighted up front — also atomic |

> The 42–53% oh-my-pi payload saving is a lighter wire format; the table above is what that
> format asks the model to hold in its head instead — renumbering, tag-chasing, node choice —
> the exact component that fails most (46–51% patch-failure rates on replace-style edits). This
> plugin's 26% is the price of a contract where a wrong edit cannot land, and any rejection
> needs no re-read.

## Benchmark

Measured on the same 103-line file with the same 12 replacements (8 single-line, 4 multi-line of
3/6/10/15 lines), tokenized with the pinned `js-tiktoken` `cl100k_base`. Three arms emit the same
replacements: this plugin's `edit` (two `<line>#<hash>` anchors), a `str_replace` tool (old
text echoed verbatim), and [`@oh-my-pi/hashline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/hashline)
in both of its modes — one `[path#tag]` section per edit (`seq`) and one multi-hunk batch
document (`batch`):

| Criterion | hashline | str_replace | oh-my-pi seq / batch |
| ----------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Replaced text sent over the wire | ✅ never | ❌ every edit | ✅ never |
| Output tokens saved (12-edit session) | ✅ **26%** | ❌ 0% | ✅ **42% / 53%** |
| Multi-line range savings (3–15 lines) | ✅ **29–47%** | ❌ 0% | ✅ **40–53%** |
| Effective cost at 5× output pricing | ✅ **~1.4× less** | ❌ 1× | ✅ **~1.7× / ~2.1× less** |
| Ranges verified against served state | ✅ 100% | ❌ none | ~ file version only |
| Line numbers the model must track | ✅ none — content anchors | ✅ none — text match | ❌ renumber every edit |
| Deterministic, reproducible locally | ✅ `npm run benchmark` | — | — |

### Reproducible

The numbers above are **deterministic and you can reproduce them locally** — `npm run benchmark`:

| Scenario | Lines | hashline | str_replace | oh-my-pi seq | oh-my-pi batch |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| single-line ×8 | 1 | 341 | 324 | 241 | — |
| multi-line ×4 | 3–15 | 408 | 691 | 349 | — |
| **TOTAL ×12** | | **749** | **1015** | **590** | **480** |

Saved vs `str_replace`: hashline **266 (26%)** · oh-my-pi per-edit **425 (42%)** · oh-my-pi batch **535 (53%)**.

> The `line#hash` contract trades ~3 chars per anchor × 2 anchors × 12 edits (~+47 tokens total,
> ~7%) vs the pre-`line#hash` numbers — 702 → 749. The qualitative conclusion holds: hashline wins
> comfortably on multi-line ranges (24–45%) and is comparable to `str_replace` on the shortest
> single-line edits, while remaining the only arm that verifies every resolved line against the
> served state and never lands a wrong-line edit silently. See [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md)
> for the per-scenario breakdown and methodology.

The script is deterministic by construction: a frozen corpus, a content-addressed edit script that
self-checks (a reformatted corpus throws instead of silently changing what's measured), a pinned
tokenizer, and oh-my-pi payloads validated against the package's published grammar before counting.
Because everything is fixed, `npm run benchmark` gives everyone the same result — the numbers in
this README are a snapshot of that run; regenerate, don't trust.

> **Scope & honesty.** The benchmark measures **request-payload tokens** — what the model emits per
> edit call — with identical read traffic excluded (it cancels) and identical replacement text.
> It does **not** model transcription failure and retries, which is where the real-world gap is
> largest: the original [harness-problem](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) post reported
> a **61% output-token reduction** and patch-failure drops from 46–51% to near zero after switching

> Bun-vs-Node runtime difference, nor the fact that `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a standalone patcher

> table, and the complete limitation list in [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md). The correctness gap behind those numbers is spelled out above in [Correctness in edge cases](#correctness-in-edge-cases).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `read` | Returns a file as `HASH IDENTIFIER │ FILE LINES` header + `<line>#<hash>│<content>` rows. Parameters: `offset` (1-based), `limit`. Paged output ends with `[Showing lines N-M of T. Use offset=… to continue.]`. Lines >200KB are shown as a marker with a `sed` hint — hash anchors need full lines. |
| `edit` | Applies one or more edits atomically via `{ path, edits: [{ op, from, to?, lines? }, …] }`. `op` is `ins` (insert after `from`), `del` (delete the from..to range), or `replace` (swap the from..to range with `lines`). Verifies **every line** of each resolved range against served state; `[E_RANGE_STALE]` / `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` / `[E_RANGE_UNVERIFIED]` reject-and-serve fresh anchors. The response carries a `Shift:` block per hunk describing how absolute line numbers below the edit moved. Replaces the legacy `batch_edit` tool (up to 32 edits per call, per-item `path` for multi-file). |
| `grep` | Search for a pattern in one or more files. Parameters: `path` · `pattern` (literal by default, regex with `regex: true`) · `-C N` (context rows) · `limit`. Output mirrors `read`: one section per file, header + `<line>#<hash>│<content>` rows. Grep is observed + recorded as served so a hit can be edited directly without a separate `read`. |
| `undo_last_edit` | `{ path }` reverts the last hashline edit, only while the file still matches the stored post-edit content; survives restarts. |

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[E_ACCESS]` | File exists but is not readable/writable by the tool. |
| `[E_AMBIGUOUS_ANCHOR]` | A hash matches more than one current line; call `read` for fresh anchors. |
| `[E_BAD_OP]` | Range end precedes range start (autocorrected when the pair was reversed). |
| `[E_BAD_REF]` | `from`/`to` is not a `<line>#<hash>` or 3-char hash. |
| `[E_BAD_SHAPE]` | Request/field shape is wrong (unknown fields, missing path, non-string text, …). |
| `[E_BARE_HASH_PREFIX]` | `<line>#<hash>│` prefix pasted into `lines` (autocorrected). |
| `[E_BATCH_ABORT]` | A batch item failed; the whole batch was rejected, nothing written. |
| `[E_FILE_TOO_LARGE]` | File exceeds the hashline line ceiling; use `write` or another approach. |
| `[E_INVALID_PATCH]` | Diff-preview markers pasted into `lines` (autocorrected). |
| `[E_NOOP_LOOP]` | The exact same edit keeps producing no change; resubmitting is rejected. |
| `[E_OP_INS]` | `op:"ins"` — inserted lines placed after the anchor; informational. |
| `[E_NOT_FOUND]` | File does not exist. |
| `[E_NOT_OBSERVED]` | The file has not been observed in this session (read-before-write policy); call `read` first. |
| `[E_NOT_TEXT]` | Path is a directory, binary, or non-UTF-8 file; hashline edits only text. |
| `[E_RANGE_STALE]` | A served line differs on disk since it was read; the range is echoed fresh. |
| `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` | The range includes lines never served to the model. |
| `[E_RANGE_UNVERIFIED]` | Boundary anchor cannot be verified against served state. |
| `[E_STALE_ANCHOR]` | Anchor(s) no longer resolve; call `read` for fresh anchors. |
| `[E_UNDO_STALE]` | Cannot undo: the file was modified (or deleted) after the edit. |
| `[E_UNDO_UNAVAILABLE]` | Undo history could not be persisted; the edit was not applied. |
| `[E_WOULD_EMPTY]` | An edit would empty a non-empty file; use `write` to clear it. |

## How It Replaces the Built-in Tools

dsh's tool registry resolves per scope: an agent sees `agent → preset → global`, and its **own**
layer always wins. The built-in `read`/`edit` live on the agent-preset layer, so a plain global
registration cannot replace them. This plugin:

1. Mounts as a host-plane Cordis plugin via its `cordis.patch.yml` bundle patch.
2. On `agent/session-start`, registers the hashline tools **and** the `tool:read` / `tool:edit`
   prompt sections on the agent's own scope layer — they shadow the preset's built-ins for that
   agent and unwind automatically when the agent is disposed.
3. Leaves the built-in `write` in place, but a scoped `tools/post-execute` listener appends the
   hashline auto-read to write results.

## Store

Hash snapshots, served-state rows, and undo history live in one SQLite store **co-located with the
workspace being edited** — one store per session cwd:

```
<workspace>/.dsh_hashline_edittool/hash-store.sqlite
```

Parallel sessions in different workspaces keep separate stores (the session cwd is carried through
each tool call), so one project's anchors and undo history never leak into another's. Outside a tool
call (tests, previews) the store falls back to the shared DeepSeek Harness home
(`$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-hashline-edittool/hash-store.sqlite`).

A 7-day TTL prunes served rows; missing-file snapshots are pruned at startup. Corrupt stores are
quarantined and rebuilt automatically. Moving to the per-workspace layout does not migrate earlier
undo history from the shared home — treat any pre-0.1.2 undo entries as gone.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest run (615 tests)
npm run build       # tsc → lib/
npm run benchmark   # reproducible token-cost benchmark (benchmark/)
```

### Releasing (tag-first)

```sh
npm run release -- 0.2.0                 # bump + CHANGELOG move + commit + tag + push → GitHub release
npm publish --registry https://registry.npmjs.org   # blocked until the version is tagged
```

`npm run release` bumps `package.json`/lockfile, moves the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section to the
version, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes — the tag push creates the GitHub release from the
changelog. `npm publish` refuses to run until that tag exists (prepublishOnly gate), so every npm
version is always already tagged and released.

The test suite is ported from pi-hashline-edit-lsz and drives the dsh tool builders directly over a
local filesystem bridge.

## Roadmap

**Current state:** line-anchored `line#hash` markers with chainable Shift blocks, `grep` tool,
per-workspace store, sandbox policy participation, the served-tail truncation fix, reproducible
benchmark, EN + 中文 READMEs, published on npm. Test count: 651 passing (35 pre-existing
sqlite-environment failures excluded).

<details><summary>Next</summary>

- **Close or justify the gap vs @oh-my-pi/hashline** (reference: [`../oh-my-pi.md`](../oh-my-pi.md)). The sibling patch language is payload-lighter — 42%/53% vs our 26% vs `str_replace` on the benchmark, because a bare patch document skips the JSON envelope we pay per call — and offers four abilities we do not support: syntactic block ops (`PUT N*:`), registers + `REM`/`MV`, one multi-hunk document per change, and a pluggable filesystem. The counterweight is correctness: its line numbers are unverified (a wrong number on a current tag lands silently), every edit renumbers, stale tags trigger best-effort 3-way merge instead of verification, and the grammar raises the model skill floor. Decide each ability reject-or-adopt on its own merits — the payload gap alone is not a reason to switch formats.
- Verify 0.1.6 live in a dsh session after the served-tail fix.
- Upstream the served-tail truncation fix to pi-hashline-edit-lsz / upstream (their `upsertServed`
  never truncates either).
- Re-check plugin wiring against the next dsh release (pinned to `0.1.0-rc.6`; dsh is in developer
  preview and promises breaking changes).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (or just open an [issue](https://github.com/hyperion2144/dsh-hashline-edittool/issues)).
The most valuable contributions right now are more benchmark scenarios and edge-case tests for the
served-state verification.

## Acknowledgments

Hash-anchored editing descends from Can Bölük's
[*The Harness Problem*](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) — the post that showed the
harness, not the model, is the bottleneck, and that anchored edits beat search-and-replace. This
project stands on the shoulders of:

- [**pi-hashline-edit**](https://github.com/RimuruW/pi-hashline-edit) by RimuruW — the original
  pi-coding-agent extension that introduced 3-character hashes and collision resolution.
- [**pi-hashline-edit-pro**](https://github.com/YuGiMob/pi-hashline-edit-pro) by YuGiMob — the
  hardened fork the hashline core here is ported from.
- [**pi-hashline-edit-lsz**](https://github.com/Rianico/pi-hashline-edit-lsz) — the self-maintained
  fork this project tracks. The hashline core is ported byte-for-byte; the tool layer is rewritten
  on dsh's plugin API.
