# dsh-hashline-edittool

Hash-anchored read/edit/batch_edit/undo_last_edit tools for DeepSeek Harness (dsh). This context covers the plugin's model-facing vocabulary: what its tools are and how the text the model reads is configured.

## Language

**Prompt section**:
A named unit in dsh's `systemPrompt` registry — one of `tool:read`, `tool:edit`, `tool:batch_edit`, `tool:undo_last_edit` — carrying a name, an `order`, and rendered text. Registered per agent on the agent's own scope layer, so it shadows the preset's built-in section of the same name.
_Avoid_: prompt, prompt entry

**Guidance**:
The editable prose of a prompt section — the usage instructions the model reads. Overridable per preset; the compiled defaults live in `src/prompts.ts`.
_Avoid_: prompt, instructions ("instructions" is `dsh-agent-instructions`' term for AGENTS.md content), guidelines (the legacy `*_GUIDELINES` constant names in `src/prompts.ts` — unify on "guidance")

**Override file**:
A `<preset>/<section>.md` plain-markdown file in the plugin's shared home that overrides one prompt section's guidance and (optionally) its `order` via front-matter. The unit users edit and reset — distinct from the preset, which is a roster composition.
_Avoid_: preset ("the preset file" is the composition row, not this override file), custom prompt

**Order**:
The numeric ordering of a prompt section within the assembled system prompt. Overridable alongside guidance.

**Preset**:
A per-session agent composition from the dsh roster (`agent.cordis.yml` plus metadata, system- or user-authored). The unit guidance overrides are keyed by; the plugin reads the agent's preset id at `agent/session-start` via `agentPresets.composedPreset`.

**Reset**:
Restoring the compiled default guidance and order for an override file. Triggered by emptying an override file without a front-matter fence, deleting it, or deleting its whole `<preset>/` directory: the plugin renders the compiled default at session-start and re-seeds at next boot — shipped presets always re-seed; a deleted custom-preset override stays absent (absence is no override).
_Avoid_: restore, regenerate, "recover the default prompt"
